# Baldur's Gate Mods
## First Mod
First mod is a custom overpowered bow reusing the models already in game. It was a hello world project to get familiar with the engine and how the RootTemplates work. The next steps for mods will have to be loading in external files and textures allowing custom models for my bow.

## End goal
The Artificer class was sadly not introduced in Baldur's Gate 3, however they can be found in the game as a families of gnomes. I want to take that aspect of the game and turn it into a full-fledged articifer class staying as true to the DnD experience.
